   <h2>C language</h2>
   <p>C is an extremely common, simple and versatile general-purpose programming language. It is machine-independent, structured programming language that is widely used in diverse applications.C was the basic language for writing everything from operating systems to complex programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.'C' is believed to be the programming language for a deity. One might say, C's a programming base. You can quickly understand the knowledge of the other programming languages that use the idea of 'C' if you learn 'C.'</p>
   <h2> python language</h2>
   <p>Python is a high-level, object-oriented, interpreted programming language with dynamic semance. Combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, its high-level data structures make it very attractive for rapid application growth,Often for use as a scripting or glue language for linking existing components. Python 's quick, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and thus reduces the cost of maintaining the software. Python supports modules and packages which promote modularity of the program and reuse of code.</p>
   <p>Programmers often fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it delivers. The edit-test-debug process is incredibly quick, because there is no compilation phase. Python debugging programs are simple: a bug or bad input will never trigger a segmentation fault. Instead it creates an exception when the translator finds an mistake.If the program fails to capture the exception, the interpreter will print a stack trace. A source level debugger allows for the analysis of local and global variables, the evaluation of arbitrary expressions, the setting of breakpoints, one line at a time through the code,And so forth. The debugger itself is written in Python, testifying to the introspective power of Python. On the other hand, often the fastest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the speedy cycle of edit-test-debug makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
   <h2>java language</h2>
   <p>Java is a widely used programming language which is specifically designed for use in the internet's distributed environment. It is the most popular programming language for Android smartphone applications and is also one of the most preferred for edge device development and the internet of things.</p>
   <p>Java was designed to have the C++ programming language look and feel, but is easier to use and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to build full applications that can run on a single device, or be spread over a network to servers and clients. It may also be used as part of a web page to build a small application module or applet for use.</p>
