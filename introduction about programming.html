     <p>For thousands of years, language has been our prime means of communication and human interaction. The vocabulary for a group contained the words people use to communicate, the words themselves are abstract, yet they show the context, refer to things or acts, etc.</p>
	 <p>Looking at your computer, you'll find that isn't that much different. Many pieces of hardware and software need to communicate with one another. Your application reacts to the mouse and keyboard, or even the microphone, it can read files from your storage disk, and so on. But in the end, the machine only understands bits, 1s, and 0s, the combination of which creates meaning</p>
	 <p>In addition, the very earliest computers were programmed by manually changing ones and zeros, alternating the circuit and cabling. Of course, designing many programs wasn't simple because most were used only for particular applications, and they were gigantic in size so they were very limited. This is why programming languages were a revolutionary step That had taken the field to a different level. Unlike normal languages, keywords are limited in programming languages, and developers are able to create different types of programs by combining these keywords. Special pieces of software are available that turn the code you write into the machine language that the machine understands.</p>
	 <h2>what is programming language? In short?</h2>
	 <p>The programming language is the collection of instructions on how people communicate with computers.</p>
