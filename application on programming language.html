   <h2>uses of programming language </h2>
   <p>Programmers interact with machines using programming languages. There are many different languages and each has its own unique features, although they all share certain similarities. Since each language is special, each one within other industries may be better suited for a specific function or purpose. Many programming languages are used to build programs for problem solving or for data analysisOther programming languages are more likely to create fun applications or games. With a strong need for special and varied programming languages, developing a single universal programming language that satisfies all the needs is nearly impossible. The programming languages are frequently updated and often merged over time with other languages to suit our changing technical needs</p>

   </p>  Python is an open source programming language used by software engineers and Web developers at the back end. Python is well suited to computing science, and learning is relatively simple.
Java is prevalent in the creation of the Internet, and it was developed in 1995. Most businesses use Java in the health sciences , education, and finance sectors. Java makes applets available for download from websites,</p>
  <p>HTML is widely used in Web development. HTML is the code that serves as the basis of Web pages, enabling people to create and structure electronic documents for online viewing.</p>
  <p>JavaScript is used by Web developers and software engineers to manipulate page elements to make them more engaging. JavaScript enhances HTML, and it is embedded in most Internet browsers.</p>
  <p>HTML is widely used in Web development. HTML is the code that serves as the basis of Web pages, enabling people to create and structure electronic documents for online viewing.</p>
  <p>C is a term used by software developers and system analysts for mid-level programming. Programmers use C to create operating system-integrating applications.</p>
  <p>C++ is another middle-level programming language developed in 1983 and works as an extension of C. Programmers use C++ to create applications for games, graphics and the office.</p>
  <p>In 1995 PHP was published to the general public. Developers use PHP to create dynamic Web pages as an open source language. Widespreadly used frameworks like WordPress and Drupal cohesively work with PHP.</p>
  <p>SQL allows programmers to create, read, update , and delete the data in a database. Companies are using the SQL to collect data.
Apple uses the programming language of Swift to create and maintain applications for the iOS and OS X. Swift 2 is a secondary open source programming language that was released by Apple more recently.</p>
